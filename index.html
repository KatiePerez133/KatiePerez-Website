        <div class="subheading mb-5">Key-Carrier üîë</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Katie Perez is a first generation college undergrad from the University of California. She is known for her passion, agility and dedication to any job position she has been offered to take. She is bilingual, competitive and adaptable as she has been able to professionally deal with many challenges within different companies. At a young age, she received a 4.0 GPA and through her highschool career, she took advantage of the opportunities given to her by taking Dual Enrollment classes. Dual Enrollment classes are offered to students who are consistent with their grade and have a standard GPA. Dual is a college course class that is considered to be an ‚Äúextra‚Äù class after your regular high school schedule. In other words, instead of having 6 classes, you typically have about 7 or 8, depending on how many classes they would like to take. In total, Katie took about 5 classes which gave her college credit, allowing her to graduate within 3 years, as planned. She was involved in School organizations such as AVID and AVID Leadership. AVID was a program specifically created to help students through the process of applying to college. As an AVID student, her expectations were high and she dedicated every opportunity she had to apply for a variety of colleges. In the process, she was able to help other students, whether it was applying for FAFSA or giving them a backstory of the different colleges and their traditions in order for them to better know what college fit their best interests.  In her free time, she enjoys going on Hikes, meeting new people and overall, enjoying her time in different social interactions. As a person, she is respectful, humorous and is open-minded as she is always willing to allow for new experiences and opportunities. <br><br>

       At a young age she was hired as a Courtesy Clerk for a Grocery Store; Stater Bros. Her duties as a CC was to ensure the organization of the store and customer service; eventually getting prompted as a General Merchandiser. At that point her responsibilities were to stock a variety of products, such as Water, Ice, Alcoholic beverages and Soda. She was in charge of the loads and communicating with different departments /customers through the use of the store phone. After a couple months of working as a Gm, she got promoted to become a checker (clerk). In order to do so, she had to go to training for 2 days at the main office in San Bernardino, where they taught her how to access fruit codes, enter secure mode and the basic components of using a checkstand. As a fast learner, she quickly adapted to the environment of being a checker. She is now responsible for dispatching every customer's orders, as well as allowing the customers to ask any question they may have about different products. As Katie has been working for the company for about 5 years, she is applying for the position of a key carrier. <br><br>

         A key- carrier is a person who is in charge of the front end, overriding punches, giving key flicks, suspending orders and overall, being in charge of the whole store when the assistant manager/manager are not present at the time. Katie Perez is the perfect candidate for this position as she has been around the company for 5 years and has the necessary skills as she knows the outline of a Key-carrier through the use of her observations, learning/listening skills and knowledge of how the store operates. With her dedication and adaptability to new environments, she is the best choice for this position. She will continue to serve as a proud member of this Company.
